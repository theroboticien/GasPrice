## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To set up Gas Price Finder on your machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Ensure Python 3.x is installed:**
    If you don't have Python, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2.  **Install Required Libraries:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the necessary Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install requests beautifulsoup4 wget
    ```

    *(Note: `tkinter` is typically included with standard Python installations, and `os`, `zipfile`, `json` are built-in modules.)*

## üöÄ Usage

Using Gas Price Finder is straightforward:

1.  **Launch the Application:**
    Navigate to the directory containing `gasprice.py` in your terminal and execute:

    ```bash
    python gasprice.py
    ```

2.  **Download Latest Prices:**
    Upon the application window appearing, click the **"Download Prices"** button. This is a crucial step that fetches and loads the most current fuel data. You'll receive a confirmation message once the download and processing are complete.

3.  **Enter Your Postal Code:**
